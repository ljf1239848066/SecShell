# SecShell

[中文说明](README_CN.md "中文")

## 1. prepare shell tool

> Only need to compile once, subsequent libshell remains unchanged, just replace the sdk.data in assets

```
gradle libshell:build
```

build libshell and copy libshell.aar to the sdk directory

## 2. prepare sdk

- build sdk

build the sdk to be reinforced, such as libcore

```
gradle libcore:build
```

After compiling, copy the aar to the sdk directory and modify the 'SDK_AAR_NAME' in gradle.properties to configure the file name of the corresponding aar

## 3. sdk proguard

- generate stub-sdk

To hide the key code of our sdk and ensure that users can develop properly, we provide stub-sdk for user `compileOnly` reference, and load the actual SDK through shell tools.
In this scheme, the stub-sdk is generated based on the reflection principle of Java. Empty Java classes are generated by loading the jar file in the aar package of SDK. 

```
gradle libsag:build
```

Compiling libsag performs the following tasks in sequence:
1. Unzip the aar file of sdk to the `sdk/sdk` directory, extract the classes.jar package from the sdk directory and rename it as `sdk.jar`
2. Extract libshell aar file to `sdk/shell` directory
3. Convert sdk.jar to sdk.dex file for encryption
4. Generate the empty Java class source code based on sdk.jar to the Java directory of corestub: `corestub/src/main/java/`, the path is specified by ` SDK_STUB_SRC_FOLDER` in gradle.properties


- encrypt sdk

 use libmix to encrypt sdk

```
gradle libmix:build
```

Compile libmix to perform the encryption task. The compile script will automatically complete the encryption dex and copy it to `sdk/shell/assets/`. Then repackage libshell as aar file and automatically copy aar to the specified demo dependent library directory, the path is specified by ` DEMO_LIB_FOLDER` in gradle.properties




- build stub-sdk

```
gradle corestub:build
```

build corestub to generate `corestub.aar` for **compileOnly** use in user app, compiling the script automatically copies aar to the demo dependent library directory, the path is specified by ` DEMO_LIB_FOLDER` in gradle.properties

## 4. build demo

```
gradle demo:build
```

build the demo project to get example apk
